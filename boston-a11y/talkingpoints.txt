Access For All

why and how


Multiple reasons for accessibility
(often abbreviated a11y)

it's the law

But there's much more

meet two of your biggest a11y users (google/bing)


Situational

Temporary (illness)

temporary (age)

or just because you're on a train

People have different abilities

re-use of content

85% of vids are watched without sound

So, how to go about it?

Automate *all the things* that can be automated

use language checks

use campaign knowledge

Contrast is important, but it's not the only thing

Good structure helps, in many ways

become a keyboard pro

new challenges: svg and icon fonts

new challenges: single page apps

don't be intimidated by the rules
actually, most of them make sense

rules can change when they don't make sense

aim for good, not for perfection
(unless you have to)
