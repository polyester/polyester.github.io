Mezzanine

takeaway:

- new systems have no ballast, but also no learning
- most don't scale well for lots of content
- only a few do multi-*: Sulu
- no export

wysiwyg is dead

deployment: no more multiple sites in one zope
subsites OK

wtf is a right column anyway

the consumer could be a bot, or a service

design rules

ui and ux rule

all forms suck

formlibraries just for programmers suck harder. It will never be an equal playing field if the devs get other toys than the site admins.

"make it so", or "engage"; the starship captain analogy
but captains do have training

readability counts. YAML is fine

config editors don't have to be pretty, just functional

make integration easy

examples
ghost md editor
civicrm using mosaicio; after having three major attempts themselves
(hits price spot, as you can then send through sparkpost instead of mailchimp)

lifetime of content:

- 20% writing outside CMS (email word files, googledocs)
- 5% get into CMS
- 75% re-arrange, re-use, refer, tag, archive

three kind of docs:

- office
- simple pages
- composites

personal: all pages should be composites potentially

Embedding is here to stay. Do not make it difficult. If it's a security risk, contain it.

xml is not for humans

import/export is the lifeblood of a site over its lifetime

subsites/minisites are far more common need than you think

drush, ghost-cli: nice

Longevity

- what happens when you have 1k + content items
- site redesign
- organizational restructuring
