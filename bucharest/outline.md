problem from user side:

money not enough for whole thing
no money most of year, then sudden
needs insurance it will happen

problem from dev side:

clients from hell
urgh bookkeeping
wants to sell dev time, not fixed price

we had getpaid
not a good success-effort ratio

yet other communities have it:

CiviCRM "Make it happen"

caveats:
- trusted devs
- or core (we don't have exact equal)

price difference
- country
- experience
- customer-related

this could also be an advantage btw
- we need more devs, worldwide
- also in the heartlands
- pull in other experiences (UX driven, design driven, doc driven, ...)

so not sure if it's real 'competition'
rather an opportunity for new talent to grow and foster
onboarding is more important in the long run, for everybody.
We need a healthy ecosystem of small firms as well
plus a good way to smooth over the ides, and a thankyou to the people now doing massive unpaid work
It is not salaried, but a reimbursement. Yes you could get a shiny new laptop for it.

but what about

core vs add-on
maintenance
security review

upgrades of add-ons could be a MiH

fair distribution?
who gets to apply?
what happens if dev does not deliver?
FWT or other independent juror  on realistic hour/amount?

fleshing out specs can be the main problem. They should have some ToR, and rules:
- best practice (api, no grok, ...)
- undocumented code = broken code
- untested code = broken code
- UX, a11y, i18n


even if this is unrealistic, still learning about org funding cycles is a skill that every outfit should learn! Often more important than the official 'tender path'.
(as is the nephew factor, btw, but that's another story)

if we don't tap into the 3000-5000 market, we are losing big time.
