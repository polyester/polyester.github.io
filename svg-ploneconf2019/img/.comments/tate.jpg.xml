The action will protest Uniqlo’s refusal to pay $5.5million of unpaid wages owed to 4000 garment workers who produced for Uniqlo in Indonesia.The garment workers in Indonesia, supported by their local trade union and an international coalition of labour rights groups including War on Want and the Clean Clothes Campaign, have been demanding that Uniqlo immediately contributes to unpaid wages for work undertaken producing clothes for the brand.War on Want has launched a public action which has seen around 9000 emails sent directly to Uniqlo’s CEO, Tadashi Yanai, demanding contribution for workers. While other, much smaller buyers have contributed, Uniqlo are refusing to pay, instead issuing a statement in response to the petition that dodged responsibility for the now unemployed workers. photograph by David Sandisonwww.dsandison.com+44 7710 576 445+44 208 979 6745</note>
