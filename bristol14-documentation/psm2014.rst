Documentation:
===============

not an afterthought
====================


----

The documentation for Plone has changed. What does that mean for documenters, integrators, and developers?

----

How can you contribute?


And how can your own projects benefit from the lessons learned?


----

A few months back...
=====================

----

developer.plone.org
-------------------

An organic collection of different docs.

Started out as documentation for developers. But soon included stuff for integrators, themers, sysadmins.

----

plone.org/documentation
-----------------------

* a hodgepodge of all kind of docs

* mostly out of date

----

There's more!
==============

plone user manual
-----------------
- good, but not many people know it
- there's even translations

(if you know where they hide...)

----

add-ons
--------
- some have nice docs, eg. PFG
- others are, well, crap
- wildly differing in style & setup

----

It was time for a change
========================



- So we started to prepare
- and drink coco-loco !

Making it happen
================

Stroopwafel Sprint
-------------------

----

The right mix
=============

A robot master, a documentation expert, a marketing person and 9 others walk into a bar...

----

Cake-driven documentation
--------------------------

- identified gaps in the documentation
- a plan for **versioning**.
- plan: consolidate **all** documentation
- the **mindmap** to rule all mindmaps

----

Cake is good
============

- multilingual: use well-known tools
- select a correct license
- disabled `knowledge base` on plone.org

----

Cathedral Sprint
================

- time to take the gloves off
- get on people's nerves
- (aka, tell developers to write docs)

:data-rotate: 90

- testing docs on humans
- (animal testing is **bad**, mmmkay)
- professional writers - sanity check!
- create structure
- copy docs to right place

----

- fix broken links
- start pulling external docs

*(git sparse is cool...)*

- new docs theme
- PDF creation via LaTeX

----

Fixed around 368 warning and bugs

Discussed writing guidelines

Cleaning up tickets from the old developer.documentation

----


- more fixing of links, typos and so on
- start add missing parts ('new collections')
- writing guidelines for add-on writers


----

First important change
=======================

----

:data-rotate: 90

License
-------
- collective -> plone
- change license
- CC 4.0 BY. kthxbye!
- sign contributor agreement*

\* or not?

----

:data-rotate: 90

docs.plone.org
==============

basic features
---------------
- one landing page for **all** docs
- including end users, themers, site admins, deployers, developers, core devs

----

fancy stuff
-----------
- different plone versions
- different languages
- transifex integration
- screen shot integration

----

collecting more docs
---------------------
- include docs for add-ons
- working pdf creation *
- 2000 pages of a4 pdf

\* for some definition of 'working'

----

:data-rotate: 90

How it works
=============

There's two repositories: 

- one with content
- one with magic

----

repository one [documentation]
--------------------------------
- just the plain rst files
- a **branch** for every version
- per language **directories**

----

:data-rotate: 90


repository two [papyrus]
--------------------------
- Is where the magic happens
- transifex integration
- pull in external docs (add-ons)
- robot screenshots


----

:data-rotate: 45

Quality insurance
==================
- No direct commits to master or branches
- we only do pull requests **with reviews**
- LaTeX is a harsh mistress (m/f)...

----

:data-rotate: 45


Guidelines
==========

- **no more PEP8**
- syntactic linebreaks

*think of the translators*

- documentation is **not** "look at the code"

(yes, we've tested on real devs)

----

:data-rotate: 45

Helper tools
=============

- mr gutenberg
- sublime text search
- firefox search add-on
- dash/zeal


----

:data-rotate: 45

Future plans
============

- themes fitting with version
- prettify with iconfonts
- site-specific screenshots
- robotize **all** the things
- integrate pointers into Plone itself

----

:data-rotate: 45

Future plans (technical)
========================

- hook docs into jenkins
- test PDF/Epub/HTML generation
- want PLIPs? Write docs!

----


What's missing?
===============

(well, apart from documentation itself...)

----

Tools: Editor
=============

- we need a better ReST editor
- there are a few great ones for MarkDown

they all rely on the same Javascript library for translation. So, we would need one that speaks ReST


----

Tools: Robot screenshots
========================

- Writing Robotests is not hard, but labour intensive
- yet the benefits are great
- so we'll need helpers

-----

We're not alone
===============

- walkhub.net 
- WriteTheDocs



----

How to contribute?
==================

- write documentation
- write tools
- help create walkthroughs
- video & screencasts *(but a11y)*

----

Your own projects
=================

- Use the guidelines
- Robot screenshots
- do not rely on autodocs

----

Plan ahead
==========

- audiences, audiences, audiences
- versioning
- licensing
- docs.plone.org, readthedocs, private?


----

Why bother?
===========

- because we're the good guys 'n girls
- how do you pick other stuff?
- it's actually not **that** much work
- and it's just pretty when done
